# NES Emulator

The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator allows users to run NES games on a non-native platform. Meaning, that the NES has its own hardware components designed to run NES ROMs (native environment); however, an emulator will allow an NES ROM to run on your own computer even though it has completely different hardware! The emulator is built off a 6502 interpreter. We plan to add support for a variety of games, including Super Mario, Super Mario Bros 3, The Legend of Zelda, Tetris, and much more. 

Please refer to the [wiki page](https://github.com/ariddl/nes/wiki) for an overview of our implementation (in progress), how to contribute, valuable resources, and guides.
